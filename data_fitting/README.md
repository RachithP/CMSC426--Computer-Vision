This folder contains different kinds of line fitting algorithms that can be used when we have a 2-D data. Typically, this is useful to find the direction or line which can define the correlation in data.

Algorithms covered are:

1. Least Square solution.
2. RANSAC.
3. Regularization. Similar to Least Sqaure, but considers noise in the data with a penalizing factor.
