#  Data fitting

Author: Rachith Prakash

This folder consists of different kinds of line fitting algorithms that can be used when we have 2-D data. Typically, this is useful to find line which can define the correlation in data.

The following algorithms are covered.

1. Linear Least Squares -> solution to AX = b.
2. RANSAC -> Probabilistic method to fit data. Outlier rejection.
3. Regularization -> similar to Least Sqaure, but considers noise in data with a penalizing factor. Outlier rejection.
