# Error Ellipse in 2-D

Author: Rachith Prakash

Given any 2-D data, e.g x and y coordinates of a set of points in 2-D space, this algorithm plots an error ellipse encompassing the datapoints.

The .pdf consists of an explanation of co-variance and variance.

Once the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are clear, this can be extended to 3-D space to get an error ellipsoid encompassing 3-D data as illustrated in https://github.com/RachithP/Computer-Vision/tree/test/Rotobrush.
