This project is an implementation of **SLAM**-*Simultaneous Localization and Mapping*, using GTSAM. It is done as part of CMSC426 course at University of Maryland, College Park.

## GTSAM toolbox installation instructions

I have already downloaded and unzipped folder of GTSAM toolbox. However, one can follow the following instructions to download and install on their own.

1. Download and unzip MATLAB precompiled gtsam-toolbox-3.2.0-win64.zip from [Borg Lab](https://borg.cc.gatech.edu/download.html).
2. Make sure you can run example files from the toolbox.
3. Make sure to add the toolbox home path along with subfolders while running any script that uses the toolbox.

## Code details

There are two datasets in implementation/code/data
